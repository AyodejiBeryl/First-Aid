With appropriate care, the binding should last the useful life of the book. Keep in mind that putting \\nexcessive flattening pressure on any binding will accelerate its failure. If you purchased a book that you believe \\nis defective, please immediately return it to the place of purchase. If you encounter ongoing issues, you can also \\ncontact Customer Service at our publisher, McGraw Hill.\\nSTART EARLY: Use this book as early as possible while learning the basic medical sciences. The first semester of \\nyour first year is not too early! Devise a study plan by reading Section I: Guide to Efficient Exam Preparation, and \\nmake an early decision on resources to use by checking Section IV: Top-Rated Review Resources. Note that First Aid \\nis neither a textbook nor a comprehensive review book, and it is not a panacea for inadequate preparation. \\nCONSIDER FIRST AID YOUR ANNOTATION HUB: Annotate this book with material from other resources, \\nsuch as class notes or comprehensive textbooks. This will keep all the high-yield information you need in one place. \\nOther tips on keeping yourself organized:\\n\\x83 For best results, use fine-tipped ballpoint pens (eg, BIC Pro+, Uni-Ball Jetstream Sport, Pilot Drawing Pen, Zebra \\nF-301). If you like gel pens, try Pentel Slicci, and for markers that dry almost immediately, consider Staedtler \\nTriplus Fineliner, Pilot Drawing Pen, and Sharpie.\\n\\x83 Consider using pens with different colors of ink to indicate different sources of information (eg, blue for \\nUSMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax, green for UWorld Step 1 Qbank, red for Rx Bricks).\\n\\x83 Choose highlighters that are bright and dry quickly to minimize smudging and bleeding through the page \\n(eg, Tombow Kei Coat, Sharpie Gel).\\n\\x83 Many students de-spine their book and get it 3-hole-punched. This will allow you to insert materials from other \\nsources, including curricular materials. \\nINTEGRATE STUDY WITH CASES, FLASH CARDS, AND QUESTIONS: To broaden your learning strategy, \\nconsider integrating your First Aid study with case-based reviews (eg, First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1), flash \\ncards (eg, USMLE-Rx Step 1 Flash Facts), and practice questions (eg, the USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax). Read the \\nchapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same \\ntopics. Maintain access to more comprehensive resources (eg, ScholarRx Bricks and USMLE-Rx Step 1 Express \\nvideos) for deeper review as needed.\\nPRIME YOUR MEMORY: Return to your annotated Sections II and III several days before taking the USMLE \\nStep 1. The book can serve as a useful way of retaining key associations and keeping high-yield facts fresh in your \\nmemory just prior to the exam. The Rapid Review section includes high-yield topics to help guide your studying.\\nCONTRIBUTE TO FIRST AID: Reviewing the book immediately after your exam can help us improve the next \\nedition. Decide what was truly high and low yield and send us your comments. Feel free to send us scanned images \\nfrom your annotated First Aid book as additional support. Of course, always remember that all examinees are under \\nagreement with the NBME to not disclose the specific details of copyrighted test material.\\nFAS1_2025_00_Frontmatter.indd   17 12/19/24   3:06 PM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

As a medical \\nstudent, you are no doubt familiar with taking standardized examinations \\nand quickly absorbing large amounts of material. When you first confront \\nthe USMLE Step 1, however, you may find it all too easy to become \\nsidetracked from your goal of studying with maximal effectiveness. Common \\nmistakes that students make when studying for Step 1 include the following:\\n\\x83 Starting to study (including First Aid) too late\\n\\x83 Starting to study intensely too early and burning out\\n\\x83 Starting to prepare for boards before creating a knowledge foundation\\n\\x83 Using inefficient or inappropriate study methods\\n\\x83 Buying the wrong resources or buying too many resources\\n\\x83 Not using question banks early in examination preparation\\n\\x83 Not using practice examinations to maximum benefit\\n\\x83 Not understanding how scoring is performed or what the result means\\n\\x83 Not using review books along with your classes\\n\\x83 Not analyzing and improving your test-taking strategies\\n\\x83 Getting bogged down by reviewing difficult topics excessively\\n\\x83 Studying material that is rarely tested on the USMLE Step 1\\n\\x83 Failing to master certain high-yield subjects owing to overconfidence\\n\\x83 Using First Aid as your sole study resource\\n\\x83 Trying to prepare for it all alone\\nIn this section, we offer advice to help you avoid these pitfalls and be more \\nproductive in your studies.\\n`USMLE STEP 1—THE BASICS\\nThe USMLE Step 1 is the first of three examinations that you would \\nnormally pass in order to become a licensed physician in the United \\nStates. The USMLE is a joint endeavor of the National Board of Medical \\nExaminers (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). \\nThe USMLE serves as the single examination system domestically and \\ninternationally for those seeking medical licensure in the United States.\\nThe Step 1 exam includes test items that can be grouped by the organiza-\\ntional constructs outlined in Table 1 (in order of tested frequency). In late \\n2020, the USMLE increased the number of items assessing communication \\nskills. While pharmacology is still tested, they are focusing on drug mecha-\\nnisms rather than on pharmacotherapy. You will not be required to identify \\nthe specific medications indicated for a specific condition. Instead, you will \\nbe asked more about drug mechanisms and side effects.\\n` The test at a glance:\\n\\x83 8-hour exam\\n\\x83 Up to a total of 280 multiple choice items\\n\\x83 7 test blocks (60 min/block)\\n\\x83 Up to 40 test items per block\\n\\x83 45 minutes of break time, plus another 15 \\nif you skip the tutorial\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   2 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

A short \\n11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the \\nsurvey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions. \\nOnce an examinee finishes a particular question block on the CBT, he or \\nshe must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Examinees \\ncannot go back and change their answers to questions from any previously \\ncompleted block. However, changing answers is allowed within a block of \\nquestions as long as the block has not been ended and if time permits.\\nWhat Is the CBT Like?\\nGiven the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become \\nfamiliar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You \\ncan access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation.\\nnbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as \\nthe one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it \\nduring the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can \\ngain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3 \\nblocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle.\\norg/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center \\nfor a fee. The practice session is available for $75 ($155 if taken outside of \\nthe US and Canada) and is divided into a short tutorial and three 1-hour \\nblocks of ~40 test items each.\\n` You can take a shortened CBT practice test at \\na Prometric center.\\nTABLE 1.

Examinees are also \\nprohibited from carrying in their books, notes, pens/pencils, and scratch \\npaper (laminated note boards and fine-tip dry erase pens will be provided \\nfor use within the testing area). Food and beverages are also prohibited \\nin the testing area. The testing centers are monitored by audio and video \\nsurveillance equipment. However, most testing centers allot each examinee \\na small locker outside the testing area in which he or she can store snacks, \\nbeverages, and personal items.\\nQuestions are typically presented in multiple choice format, with 4 or more \\npossible answer options. There is a countdown timer on the lower left corner \\nof the screen as well. There is also a button that allows the examinee to mark \\na question for review. If a given question happens to be longer than the \\nscreen, a scroll bar will appear on the right, allowing the examinee to see the \\nrest of the question. Regardless of whether the examinee clicks on an answer \\nchoice or leaves it blank, he or she must click the “Next” button to advance \\nto the next question.\\nThe USMLE features a small number of media clips in the form of audio \\nand/or video. There may even be a question with a multimedia heart sound \\nsimulation. In these questions, a digital image of a torso appears on the \\nscreen, and the examinee directs a digital stethoscope to various auscultation \\npoints to listen for heart and breath sounds. The USMLE orientation \\nmaterials include several practice questions in these formats. During the \\nexam tutorial, examinees are given an opportunity to ensure that both the \\naudio headphones and the volume are functioning properly. If you are \\nalready familiar with the tutorial and planning on skipping it, first skip ahead \\nto the section where you can test your headphones. After you are sure the \\nheadphones are working properly, proceed to the exam.\\nThe examinee can call up a window displaying normal laboratory values. \\nIn order to do so, he or she must click the “Lab” icon on the top part of \\nthe screen. Afterward, the examinee will have the option to choose between \\n“Blood,” “Cerebrospinal,” “Hematologic,” or “Sweat and Urine.” The \\nnormal values screen may obscure the question if it is expanded. The \\nexaminee may have to scroll down to search for the needed lab values. You \\nmight want to memorize some common lab values so you spend less time on \\nquestions that require you to analyze these.\\nThe CBT interface provides a running list of questions on the left part of the \\nscreen at all times. The software also permits examinees to highlight or cross \\nout information by using their mouse. There is a “Notes” icon on the top \\npart of the screen that allows students to write notes to themselves for review \\nat a later time.

Check with the test center you \\nwant to use before making your exam plans.\\nUS students can apply to take Step 1 at the NBME website. This application \\nallows you to select one of 12 overlapping three-month blocks in which to be \\ntested (eg, April–May–June, June–July–August). Choose your three-month \\neligibility period wisely. If you need to reschedule outside your initial three-\\nmonth period, you can request a one-time extension of eligibility for the next \\ncontiguous three-month period, and pay a rescheduling fee. The application \\nalso includes a photo ID form that must be certified by an official at your \\nmedical school to verify your enrollment. After the NBME processes your \\napplication, it will send you a scheduling permit.\\nThe scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain your \\nUSMLE identification number, the eligibility period in which you may \\ntake the exam, and two additional numbers. The first of these is known as \\nyour “scheduling number.” You must have this number in order to make \\nyour exam appointment with Prometric. The second number is known as \\nthe “candidate identification number,” or CIN. Examinees must enter their \\nCINs at the Prometric workstation in order to access their exams. However, \\nyou will not be allowed to bring your permit into the exam and will be asked \\nto copy your CIN onto your scratch paper. Prometric has no access to the \\ncodes. Make sure to bring a paper or electronic copy of your permit with \\nyou to the exam! Also bring an unexpired, government-issued photo ID that \\nincludes your signature (such as a driver’s license or passport). Make sure \\nthe name on your photo ID exactly matches the name that appears on your \\nscheduling permit.\\nOnce you receive your scheduling permit, you may access the Prometric \\nwebsite or call Prometric’s toll-free number to arrange a time to take the \\nexam.

Most US medical students attending \\na school which uses the 18-month preclerkship curriculum choose the \\nDecember–February or January–March period.\\nWhat If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?\\nYou can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at \\n1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to \\nhave your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must \\nspeak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not \\nsuffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least \\n46 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled \\ntest date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.\\nWhen Should I Register for the Exam?\\nYou should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your \\ndesired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test \\ncenter, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early \\nwill guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one \\nwithin a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students, \\nthe desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship \\ncurriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship \\nschedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus \\nUS medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of \\na June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date.

Here’s a breakdown of the \\nexam schedule:\\n15 minutes   Tutorial (skip if familiar with test format and features)\\n7 hours Seven 60-minute question blocks\\n45 minutes Break time (includes time for lunch)\\nThe computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed on the exam. \\nHowever, the computer will show you only how much time you have \\nremaining in a given block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you \\nare pacing yourself properly (at a rate of approximately one question per 90 \\nseconds).\\nThe computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted \\ntime for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a \\nshort break when you need one and have time to eat. You must be especially \\ncareful not to spend too much time in between blocks (you should keep track \\nof how much time elapses from the time you finish a block of questions to the \\ntime you start the next block). After you finish one question block, you’ll need \\nto click to proceed to the next block of questions. If you do not click within \\n30\\xa0seconds, you will automatically be entered into a break period.\\nBreak time for the day is 45 minutes, but you are not required to use all of \\nit, nor are you required to use any of it. You can gain extra break time (but \\nnot extra time for the question blocks) by skipping the tutorial or by finishing \\na block ahead of the allotted time. Any time remaining on the clock when \\nyou finish a block gets added to your remaining break time. Once a new \\nquestion block has been started, you may not take a break until you have \\nreached the end of that block. If you do so, this will be recorded as an \\n“unauthorized break” and will be reported on your final exam report. \\nFinally, be aware that it may take a few minutes of your break time to “check \\nout” of the secure resting room and then “check in” again to resume testing, \\nso plan accordingly.

The CBSE contains four blocks \\nof 50 questions each and covers material that is typically learned during the \\nbasic science years. CBSE scores represent the percent of content mastered and \\nshow an estimated probability of passing Step 1. Many schools use this test to \\ngauge whether a student is expected to pass Step 1. If this test is offered by your \\nschool, it is usually conducted at the end of regular didactic time before any \\ndedicated Step 1 preparation. If you do not encounter the CBSE before your \\ndedicated study time, you need not worry about taking it. Use the information \\nto help set realistic goals and timetables for your success. \\nThe NBME also offers six forms of Comprehensive Basic Science Self-\\nAssessment (CBSSA). Students who prepared for the exam using this web-\\nbased tool reported that they found the format and content highly indicative \\nof questions tested on the actual exam. In addition, the CBSSA is a fair \\npredictor of historical USMLE performance. The test interface, however, \\ndoes not match the actual USMLE test interface, so practicing with these \\nforms alone is not advised.\\nThe CBSSA exists in two formats: standard-paced and self-paced, both of \\nwhich consist of four sections of 50 questions each (for a total of 200 multiple \\nchoice items). The standard-paced format allows the user up to 75 minutes \\n` Depending on the resource used, practice \\nquestions may be easier than the actual \\nexam.\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   9 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Every few years, new forms are released and older \\nones are retired, reflecting changes in exam content. Therefore, the newer \\nexams tend to be more similar to the actual Step 1, and scores from these \\nexams tend to provide a better estimation of exam day performance. \\nKeep in mind that this bank of questions is available only on the web. The \\nNBME requires that users start and complete the exam within 90 days of \\npurchase. Once the assessment has begun, users are required to complete \\nthe sections within 20 days. Following completion of the questions, the \\nCBSSA provides a performance profile indicating the user’s relative \\nstrengths and weaknesses, much like the report profile for the USMLE Step \\n1 exam. In addition to the performance profile, examinees will be informed \\nof the number of questions answered incorrectly. You will have the ability \\nto review the text of all questions with detailed explanations. The NBME \\ncharges $62 for each assessment, payable by credit card or money order. For \\nmore information regarding the CBSE and the CBSSA, visit the NBME’s \\nwebsite at www.nbme.org.\\nThe NBME scoring system is weighted for each assessment exam. While \\nsome exams seem more difficult than others, the equated percent correct \\nreported takes into account these inter-test differences. Also, while \\nmany students report seeing Step 1 questions “word-for-word” out of the \\nassessments, the NBME makes special note that no live USMLE questions \\nare shown on any NBME assessment.\\nLastly, the International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) offers a Basic \\nScience Examination (BSE) practice exam at participating Prometric test \\ncenters for $200. Students may also take the self-assessment test online for \\n$35 through the NBME’s website. The IFOM BSE is intended to determine \\nan examinee’s relative areas of strength and weakness in general areas of \\nbasic science—not to predict performance on the USMLE Step 1 exam—\\nand the content covered by the two examinations is somewhat different. \\nHowever, because there is substantial overlap in content coverage and many \\nIFOM items were previously used on the USMLE Step 1, it is possible to \\nroughly project IFOM performance onto the historical USMLE Step 1 \\nscore scale. More information is available at http://www.nbme.org/ifom/.\\n`LEARNING STRATEGIES\\nMany students feel overwhelmed during the preclinical years and struggle to \\nfind an effective learning strategy. Table 3 lists several learning strategies you \\ncan try and their estimated effectiveness for Step 1 preparation based on the \\nliterature (see References). These are merely suggestions, and it’s important \\nto take your learning preferences into account. Your comprehensive \\nlearning approach will contain a combination of strategies (eg, elaborative \\ninterrogation followed by practice testing, mnemonics review using spaced \\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   10 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Practicing \\ntopics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem \\nintuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer-\\nterm retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that \\ninvolve problem solving.5\\nIn addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your \\nnotes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in \\nrandom order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in \\nmind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information \\nretrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.\\nDistributed Practice\\nAlso called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed \\npractice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out \\nintervals (days to weeks to months). Massed learning may produce more \\nshort-term gains and satisfaction, but learners who use distributed practice \\nhave better mastery and retention over the long term.5,9\\nFlash cards are a simple way to incorporate both distributed practice and \\npractice testing. Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash \\ncards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.6,8,10\\nApps with automated spaced-repetition software (SRS) for flash cards exist for \\nsmartphones and tablets, so the cards are accessible anywhere. Proceed with \\ncaution: there is an art to making and reviewing cards. The ease of quickly \\ndownloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is \\nunsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace, \\nthe thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1 \\npreparation. Unless you have specific high-yield cards (and have checked \\nthe content with high-yield resources), stick to pre-made cards by reputable \\nsources that curate the vast amount of knowledge for you. \\nIf you prefer pen and paper, consider using a planner or spreadsheet to \\norganize your study material over time. Distributed practice allows for \\nsome forgetting of information, and the added effort of recall over time \\nstrengthens the learning.\\nMODERATE EFFICACY\\nMnemonics\\nA “mnemonic” refers to any device that assists memory, such as acronyms, \\nmental imagery (eg, keywords with or without memory palaces), etc. Keyword \\nmnemonics have been shown to produce superior knowledge retention \\nwhen compared with rote memorization in many scenarios. However, they \\nare generally more effective when applied to memorization-heavy, keyword-\\nfriendly topics and may not be broadly suitable. 5  Keyword mnemonics may \\nnot produce long-term retention, so consider combining mnemonics with \\ndistributed, retrieval-based practice (eg, via flash cards with SRS).\\n` Studies have linked spaced repetition \\nlearning with flash cards to improved long-\\nterm knowledge retention and higher exam \\nscores.\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   12 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

If you can create your own mnemonic that accurately \\nrepresents the material, this will be more memorable. When topics are \\ncomplex and accurate mnemonics are challenging to create, pre-made \\nmnemonics may be more effective, especially if you are inexperienced at \\ncreating mnemonics.11\\nElaborative Interrogation/Self-Explanation\\nElaborative interrogation (“why” questions) and self-explanation (general \\nquestioning) prompt learners to generate explanations for facts. When \\nreading passages of discrete facts, consider using these techniques, which \\nhave been shown to be more effective than rereading (eg, improved recall \\nand better problem-solving/diagnostic performance).5,12,13\\nConcept Mapping\\nConcept mapping is a method for graphically organizing knowledge, with \\nconcepts enclosed in boxes and lines drawn between related concepts. \\nCreating or studying concept maps may be more effective than other \\nactivities (eg, writing or reading summaries/outlines). However, studies have \\nreached mixed conclusions about its utility, and the small size of this effect \\nraises doubts about its authenticity and pedagogic significance.14\\nLOW EFFICACY\\nRereading\\nWhile the most commonly used method among surveyed students, \\nrereading has not been shown to correlate with grade point average. 9 Due to \\nits popularity, rereading is often a comparator in studies on learning. Other \\nstrategies that we have discussed (eg, practice testing) have been shown to be \\nsignificantly more effective than rereading.\\nHighlighting/Underlining\\nBecause this method is passive, it tends to be of minimal value for learning \\nand recall. In fact, lower-performing students are more likely to use these \\ntechniques.9 Students who highlight and underline do not learn how \\nto actively recall learned information and thus find it difficult to apply \\nknowledge to exam questions.\\nSummarization\\nWhile more useful for improving performance on generative measures (eg, \\nfree recall or essays), summarization is less useful for exams that depend on \\nrecognition (eg, multiple choice). Findings on the overall efficacy of this \\nmethod have been mixed.5\\n` Elaborative interrogation and self-\\nexplanation prompt learners to generate \\nexplanations for facts, which improves recall \\nand problem solving.\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   13 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Organize and commit to studying from the beginning so \\nthat when the time comes to prepare for the USMLE, you will be ready with \\na strong foundation.\\nMake a Schedule\\nAfter you have defined your goals, map out a study schedule that is consistent \\nwith your objectives, your vacation time, the difficulty of your ongoing \\ncoursework, and your family and social commitments. Determine whether you \\nwant to spread out your study time or concentrate it into 10-hour study days in \\nthe final weeks. Then factor in your own history in preparing for standardized \\nexaminations (eg, SAT, MCAT). Talk to students at your school who have \\nrecently taken Step 1. Ask them for their study schedules, especially those who \\nhave study habits and goals similar to yours. Sample schedules can be found at \\nhttps://firstaidteam.com/schedules/. \\nTypically, US medical schools allot between four and eight weeks for \\ndedicated Step 1 preparation. The time you dedicate to exam preparation \\nwill depend on your confidence in comfortably achieving a passing score \\nas well as your success in preparing yourself during the first two years of \\nmedical school. Some students reserve about a week at the end of their \\nstudy period for final review; others save just a few days. When you have \\nscheduled your exam date, do your best to adhere to it.\\nMake your schedule realistic, and set achievable goals. Many students make \\nthe mistake of studying at a level of detail that requires too much time for a \\ncomprehensive review—reading Gray’s Anatomy in a couple of days is not a \\nrealistic goal! Have one catch-up day per week of studying. No matter how \\nwell you stick to your schedule, unexpected events happen. But don’t let \\nyourself procrastinate because you have catch-up days; stick to your schedule \\nas closely as possible and revise it regularly on the basis of your actual \\nprogress. Be careful not to lose focus. Beware of feelings of inadequacy when \\ncomparing study schedules and progress with your peers. Avoid others who \\nstress you out. Focus on a few top-rated resources that suit your learning \\nstyle—not on some obscure resource your friends may pass down to you. \\nAccept the fact that you cannot learn it all.\\nYou will need time for uninterrupted and focused study. Plan your \\npersonal affairs to minimize crisis situations near the date of the test. Allot \\nan adequate number of breaks in your study schedule to avoid burnout. \\nMaintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, exercise, and sleep.\\nAnother important aspect of your preparation is your studying environment. \\nStudy where you have always been comfortable studying.

The main point here is to create a \\ncomfortable environment with minimal distractions.\\nY ear(s) Prior\\nThe knowledge you gained during your first two years of medical school and \\neven during your undergraduate years should provide the groundwork on \\nwhich to base your test preparation. Student scores on NBME subject tests \\n(commonly known as “shelf exams”) have been shown to be highly correlated \\nwith subsequent Step 1 performance. 15 Moreover, undergraduate science \\nGPAs as well as MCAT scores are strong predictors of performance on the \\nStep 1 exam.16\\nWe also recommend that you buy highly rated review books early in your first \\nyear of medical school and use them as you study throughout the two years. \\nWhen Step 1 comes along, these books will be familiar and personalized to the \\nway in which you learn. It is risky and intimidating to use unfamiliar review \\nbooks in the final two or three weeks preceding the exam. Some students find \\nit helpful to personalize and annotate First Aid throughout the curriculum.\\nMonths Prior\\nReview test dates and the application procedure. Testing for the USMLE \\nStep 1 is done on a year-round basis. If you have disabilities or special cir-\\ncumstances, contact the NBME as early as possible to discuss test accommo-\\ndations (see the Section I Supplement at www.firstaidteam.com/bonus).\\nUse this time to finalize your ideal schedule. Consider upcoming breaks \\nand whether you want to relax or study. Work backward from your test date \\nto make sure you finish at least one question bank. Also add time to redo \\nmissed or flagged questions (which may be half the bank).

It may be beneficial to adjust your schedule to start waking up \\nat the same time that you will on your test day. And of course, make sure to \\nmaintain a healthy lifestyle and get enough sleep. \\nOne Day Prior\\nTry your best to relax and rest the night before the test. Double-check your \\nadmissions and test-taking materials as well as the comfort measures discussed \\nearlier so that you will not have to deal with such details on the morning of \\nthe exam.

You are investing not \\nonly money but also your limited study time. Do not worry about finding \\nthe “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one, and different \\nstudents prefer different formats. Supplement your chosen books with personal \\nnotes from other sources, including what you learn from question banks.\\nThere are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and \\nthose that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, \\nand you must decide if that style works for you. However, a given style is not \\noptimal for every subject.\\nYou should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions \\nreflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes. \\nTake into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1. \\nApps\\nWith the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly \\npopular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are \\ncompatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review \\nresources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with \\ntheir software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer \\napp versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while \\naway from a computer (eg, while traveling).\\nPractice Tests\\nTaking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths \\nand weaknesses in your fund of knowledge and test-taking skills. Some \\nstudents use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the \\nmonotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas \\nother students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to \\none or more high-quality question banks. \\nAdditionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to \\nincorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the \\nwards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE \\nStep 1 aims to directly address this need.\\nAfter taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer \\nchoice whether you were right or wrong.

We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might \\nwork for you.\\nPacing\\nYou have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one-\\nhour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately \\n90\\xa0seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace \\nyourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure \\nabout the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess, \\nand move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20\\xa0minutes \\nleft after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your \\nmarked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental \\nand do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental \\nquestions are the ones that are stumping you).

One technique begins \\nwith identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal \\nshould be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a \\nreasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all \\nimpossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and \\nturn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the \\nanswer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question \\n(the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only \\ninformation relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly \\nhelpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques \\non practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed, \\nremember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.\\nGuessing\\nThere is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left \\nwith unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate \\nincorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that \\ndozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain \\nstatistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual \\nor unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development \\nprocess for future exams.\\nChanging Y our Answer\\nThe conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers. \\nHowever, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely \\nto change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way \\naround. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed \\nfrom right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback \\nto judge how good a second-guesser you are. If you have extra time, reread \\nthe question stem and make sure you didn’t misinterpret the question.\\n`CLINICAL VIGNETTE STRATEGIES\\nIn recent years, the USMLE Step 1 has become increasingly clinically \\noriented. This change mirrors the trend in medical education toward \\nintroducing students to clinical problem solving during the basic science \\nyears. The increasing clinical emphasis on Step 1 may be challenging to \\nthose students who attend schools with a more traditional curriculum.\\n` Go with your first hunch, unless you are \\ncertain that you are a good second-guesser.\\n` Be prepared to read fast and think on your \\nfeet!\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   21 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Remember that the question is often indirectly asking \\nsomething you already know.\\nA pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to \\nthat of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus \\nthe material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the \\nquestion. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE \\nStep 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is \\nimportant to answer the associated question correctly.\\nStrategy\\nRemember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in \\ntheir most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for \\nlupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that \\nthe question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords. \\nSometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm \\nor reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or \\nout. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.\\nMaking a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not \\ninfrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have \\njust struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own. \\nThe question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease. \\nConsider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long \\nstem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast \\nmay warp your perception of what the vignette is asking.\\n`IF YOU THINK YOU FAILED\\nAfter taking the test, it is normal for many examinees to feel unsure about \\ntheir performance, despite the majority of them achieving a passing score. \\nHistorical pass data are in Table 2. If you remain quite concerned, it may \\nbe wise to prepare a course of action should you need to retest. There are \\nseveral sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that \\nyou do not achieve a passing score. First, save and organize all your study \\nmaterials, including review books, practice tests, and notes. Familiarize \\nyourself with the reapplication procedures for Step 1, including application \\ndeadlines and upcoming test dates. \\n` Practice questions that include case histories \\nor descriptive vignettes are critical for Step 1 \\npreparation.\\n` Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or \\ndisorders in their most classic presentation.\\nFAS1_2025_00_Section_I.indd   22 12/20/24   11:44 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

The \\ninformation is presented in a partially organ-based format. Hence, Section \\nII is devoted to the foundational principles of biochemistry, microbiology, \\nimmunology, basic pathology, basic pharmacology, and public health \\nsciences. Section III focuses on organ systems, with subsections covering \\nthe embryology, anatomy and histology, physiology, clinical pathology, and \\nclinical pharmacology relevant to each. Each subsection is then divided \\ninto smaller topic areas containing related facts. Individual facts are \\ngenerally presented in a three-column format, with the Title of the fact in \\nthe first column, the Description of the fact in the second column, and the \\nMnemonic or Special Note in the third column. Some facts do not have a \\nmnemonic and are presented in a two-column format. Others are presented \\nin list or tabular form in order to emphasize key associations. \\nThe database structure used in Sections II and III is useful for reviewing \\nmaterial already learned. These sections are not ideal for learning complex \\nor highly conceptual material for the first time.\\nThe database of high-yield facts is not comprehensive. Use it to complement \\nyour core study material and not as your primary study source. The facts and \\nnotes have been condensed and edited to emphasize the high-yield material, \\nand as a result, each entry is “incomplete” and arguably “over-simplified.” \\nOften, the more you research a topic, the more complex it becomes, with \\ncertain topics resisting simplification. Determine your most efficient \\nmethods for learning the material, and do not be afraid to abandon a strategy \\nif it is not working for you.\\nOur database of high-yield facts is updated annually to keep current with \\nnew trends in boards emphasis, including clinical relevance. However, we \\nmust note that inevitably many other high-yield topics are not yet included \\nin our database.\\nWe actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit high-yield \\ntopics, well-written entries, diagrams, clinical images, and useful mnemonics \\nso that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit \\nrecommendations of alternate tools for study that may be useful in preparing \\nfor the examination, such as charts, flash cards, apps, and online resources \\n(see How to Contribute, p. xv).\\nSECTION II HIGH-YIELD GENERAL PRINCIPLESHIGH-YIELD GENERAL PRINCIPLES28\\nFAS1_2025_01-Biochem.indd   28 12/19/24   3:54 PM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

However, information \\nabout patient preferences may be absent at the time patients require this intervention to survive. \\nMedical decision-making frequently relies on surrogate decision-makers (patient identified or \\nlegally appointed) when discussing the continuation or withdrawal of ventilatory support, focusing \\non both the prognosis of the condition and the believed wishes of the patient. \\nIf surrogates indicate patient would not have wanted to receive life support with ventilation p\\nwithhold or withdraw life support regardless of what the surrogate prefers.\\nIf the decision is made to withhold or withdraw life support, involve palliative care, chaplain services, \\nand the primary care physician in medical discussions with the family and provide emotional support.\\nSurrogate decision-\\nmaker\\nIf a patient loses decision-making capacity and has not prepared an advance directive, individuals \\n(surrogates) who know the patient must determine what the patient would have done. Priority \\nof surrogates: spouse p\\xa0adult children p parents p\\xa0adult siblings p\\xa0other relatives (the spouse \\nchips in).\\nConfidentiality Confidentiality respects patient privacy and autonomy. If the patient is incapacitated or the \\nsituation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by \\nprofessional judgment of patient’s best interest. The patient may voluntarily waive the right to \\nconfidentiality (eg, insurance company request).\\nGeneral principles for exceptions to confidentiality:\\n\\x83 Potential physical harm to self or others is serious and imminent\\n\\x83 Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible\\n\\x83 Steps can be taken to prevent harm\\nExamples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following \\n(“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”):\\n\\x83 Patients with active Suicidal/homicidal ideation\\n\\x83 Abuse (children, older adults, and/or prisoners)\\n\\x83 Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow \\nprotect potential Victim from harm\\n\\x83 Patients with Epilepsy and other impaired automobile drivers\\n\\x83 Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn \\npublic officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as \\nTB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.\\nAccepting gifts from \\npatients\\nA complex subject without definitive regulations. Some argue that the patient-physician \\nrelationship is strengthened through accepting a gift from a patient, while others argue that \\nnegative consequences outweigh the benefits of accepting any gift.\\nIn practice, patients often present items such as cards, baked goods, and inexpensive gifts to \\nphysicians. The physician’s decision to accept or decline is based on an individual assessment of \\nwhether or not the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefit.\\n\\x83 Physicians should not accept gifts that are inappropriately large or valuable.\\n\\x83 Gifts should not be accepted if the physician identifies that the gift could detrimentally affect \\npatient care.\\n\\x83 Gifts that may cause emotional or financial stress for the patient should not be accepted.\\nIf a gift violates any of the guidelines above, the best practice is to thank the patient for offering \\na kind gift, but politely indicate that it must be declined. During this conversation it should be \\nemphasized that the incident does not influence the physician-patient relationship in any way.\\nFAS1_2025_06-PubHealth.indd   269 12/19/24   3:17 PM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Within each Organ System are several subsections, including \\nEmbryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As \\nyou progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in \\nthe previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a \\n“vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice \\nfor studying the organ systems by these subsections.\\nEmbryology\\nRelevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology \\ntends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to \\ncongenital malformations.\\nAnatomy\\nSeveral topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, \\nand neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do \\nnot ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned \\nand what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more \\nsteps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, \\nelectron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an \\nunderstanding of the clinical significance of the structure.\\nWhile studying, emphasize clinically relevant material. For example, be \\nfamiliar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy related to specific diseases \\n(eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, \\nsensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and \\ncommon surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on \\nthe exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students \\nsuggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and \\nhistology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body \\n(eg,\\xa0 sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). \\nBasic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional \\nanatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good \\nyield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for \\nillustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.\\nPhysiology\\nThe portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept \\noriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Graphs and \\ndiagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number \\nof questions requiring their interpretation. Learn to apply basic physiologic \\nrelationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance equations). \\nYou are seldom asked to perform complex calculations, though simple \\nFAS1_2025_07-Cardio.indd   280 12/20/24   9:48 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",

Hormones are the \\nfocus of many questions; learn where, why, and how they are synthesized and \\nreleased, their regulatory mechanisms and sites of action.\\nA large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically \\nrelevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with \\npathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). \\nThus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with \\ncommon pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, \\nGI tract) and endocrine glands.\\nPathology\\nQuestions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because of \\nthe sheer volume of material involved. Review the underlying physiology, \\nbasic principles, and hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given \\nthe clinical orientation of Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the \\n“buzzword” associations of certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and \\nneurofibromatosis); you must also recognize the clinical descriptions of \\nthese high-yield physical exam findings.\\nGiven the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to \\nreview the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as \\ntheir associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and \\npathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United \\nStates (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, \\nischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step \\nbeyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications. \\nThe examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and \\nphotographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief \\nclinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before \\nlooking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the \\npathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color \\natlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days \\nbefore the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, \\noccupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.\\nPharmacology\\nPreparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning \\nall the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, \\nand important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the \\nprototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn \\nthe “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother \\nwith drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, \\nphysiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. \\nThere is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular \\nagents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer \\ndrugs on the market are also fair game.\\nFAS1_2025_07-Cardio.indd   281 12/20/24   9:48 AM\\nWww.Medicalstudyzone.com'),\n",
